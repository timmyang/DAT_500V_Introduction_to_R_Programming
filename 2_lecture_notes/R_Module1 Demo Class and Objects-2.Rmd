## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Demo: Class and Objects
## Code Chunk 1
## Assign value to object
```{r echo = TRUE}
x1 = 0.02  #assign values to object with =
y1 <- "0.01" #assign values to object with <-
z1 = TRUE
```

## Code Chunk 2
## Use class() function
```{r}
class(x1) 
class(y1)
class(z1)
```

## Code Chunk 3
## Case sensitive
```{r}
X1 = 100  #Case sensitive x1 is not same as X1
X1
x1        # original value of x1 = 0.02
```

## Code Chunk 4
## Naming an object
```{r error=TRUE}
1x = 200  # name should not start with number
```

## Code Chunk 5
## Overwritten
```{r}
x1  # original value of x1 = 0.02
x1 + 5  # + is for numeric class
x1 # x1 is not overwritten
x1 = x1 + 5  # x1 is overwritten
x1 # x1 has a new value
```

## Code Chunk 6
## Class-specific operators
```{r}
class("TRUE")
"TRUE" + 1
class(TRUE)
TRUE + 1
2 + "2"  
```

## Use save() function to save the objects 
## Multiple R objects could be stored into one RData file
## When to save R objects?
## Export for sharing/future reference
## Save a copy of important things in case R Crashes(which is very likely to happen)
## save(obj1,obj2,...,file="file_name.RData")

## Code Chunk 7
## Save Your Objects
```{r}
Prior = c(0.3,0.2,0.5)
Likelihood = c(0.01, 0.03, 0.02)

save(Prior,Likelihood,file="probabilities.RData")
```



## Code Chunk 8
## first remove the two objects
```{r,eval=FALSE}
rm(Prior,Likelihood) # let's first remove the two stored objects from the environment
Prior #object is removed, R returned error message
Likelihood #object is removed, R returned error message
```



## Code Chunk 9
## load the RData file back
## Use load() function to load RData file into current environment
```{r}
load("probabilities.RData") # load the stored data back
Prior
Likelihood
```
