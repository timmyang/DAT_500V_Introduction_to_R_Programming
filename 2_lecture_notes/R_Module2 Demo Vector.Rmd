## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Demo: Vector
## Code Chunk 1
## Multiple ways to innitialize an empty vector
```{r}
u = vector("numeric",length = 3) # an empty numeric vector of length 3
u
v = numeric(5) # an empty numeric vector of length 5
v
w = vector("character", length = 4) # an empty character vector of length 4
w
z = character(2) # an empty character vector of length 2
z
```


## Code Chunk 2
## use c() to construct a vector with values
## Examine the vectors
```{r echo = TRUE}
x = c(1,2,3,4)  #numeric vector
x
length(x)
class(x)

y = c("1","2","hello","R") #character vector
y
length(y)
class(y)
```


## Code Chunk 3
## Adding Elements to existing vector
```{r}
x
x = c(x,5) # add a new element to x
x
```


## Code Chunk 4
## Homogenous data type
```{r}
c(1,"hello",TRUE)   # every element will be transformed to character, as there are  " " around 1 and TRUE
```


## Code Chunk 5
## Constructing numeric vectors of specific structure

```{r}
a = 3:7 ## Use a:b to denote the starting point a and ending point b and create continous sequence
a

b = seq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2) # sequence of numbers from 1 to 9 incremented by 2
b

c = rep(3,4)  # replicate 3 for 4 times
c
```


## Code Chunk 6
## Some functions for numeric vectors & vector calculation
```{r}
x 
class(x)  # x is a numeric vector

length(x)  # return the length of x

sd(x)  # return the standard deviation of x

min(x)  # return the minimal of x

max(x)  # return the maximal of x
```

## Code Chunk 7
## Overwritten
```{r}
x+1 # add 1 on each element
exp(x)  # take expoential on each element
x[1] + 10 # add 1 on the first element
x[1] # x[1] is not overwritten
x[1] = x[1]+10  # x[1] is overwritten
x[1]
```



## Code Chunk 8
## Accesing data from numeric or character vectors
## For vector, each element has a position, which positions you want to access?
## use [n] to denote the position n you want to access
## use [1:3] to specify the starting position and ending position
# use [c(1,3)] to specify separate positions
# use [-n] to show all the elements except n

```{r}
x

x[1] # returns the first element

x[1:3] # returns elements 1 to 3

x[c(1,3)] # returns elements 1 and 3

x[-3] #returns everything but the third element
```

## Code Chunk 9
## Data Type Coercion: Class really matters!
## mean() only works for numeric, does not work on character

```{r}
z = c("1","2","3") # create a character vector

class(z)

mean(z)  # cannot calculate mean

is.numeric(z)  # check whether it is numeric

z = as.numeric(z)  # transform data type

z

mean(z) #now we can calculate mean

z = as.character(z)

z
```

## Code Chunk 10
## Missing Values in Vector

## In R, missing values are represented by the string NA
## Any computation involving a NA will return a NA
## Use is.na() to test whether every element 
## Use anyNA() to test whether a vector contains a NA 
## na.rm = TRUE is an argument in many stat function to remove NA values when computing

```{r}
x = c(1,4,7,NA,12,19,15,21,20)

mean(x) # cannot calculate mean because of NA among the elements

is.na(x) 

anyNA(x)

mean(x,na.rm = TRUE)  # remove NA from x, then calculate the mean()
```
