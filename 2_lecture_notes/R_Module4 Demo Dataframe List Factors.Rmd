## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Data.frame 
## Code Chunk 1
## Example: a Built-in Data Frame
## See the description of a built-in data.frame mtcars
```{r}
help(mtcars) 
```

## Code Chunk 2
## Use head() to print the first several cars
```{r}
head(mtcars,2) # see the first 2 rows
```

## Code Chunk 3
## Use tail() to print the last several cars
```{r}
tail(mtcars,2) # see the last 2 rows
```

## Code Chunk 4
## colnames(),rownames(),nrow(),ncol() to check a data.frame
```{r}
colnames(mtcars) # names of columns
rownames(mtcars) # name of rows
ncol(mtcars) # number of columns
nrow(mtcars) # number of rows
```

## Code Chunk 5
## Creating a data.frame object
## Use the data.frame() constructor to create a dataframe object with a collection of vectors
## Each vector is one attribute of the data, takes one column
## Each column should have same length 
## Use as.data.frame() to tranform other data types to data.frame
```{r}
name = c("Messi","Ronaldo","Neymar") # a character vector
age = c(32,34,27) # a numeric vector
golden_ball = c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)
players = data.frame(name,age,golden_ball)
head(players)
```


## Code Chunk 6
## Columns of different length is not taken by data.frame
```{r}
golden_ball = c(TRUE,TRUE) # golden ball has one missing value
length(name) # length is 3
length(golden_ball) # length is two
data.frame(name,golden_ball) # data frame do not accept columns of different lengths
```


## Code Chunk 7
## Use NA to place missing value
```{r}
golden_ball = c(TRUE,TRUE,NA) # use NA to indicate missing value 
data.frame(name,age,golden_ball) 
```

## Code Chunk 8
## as.data.frame() coerce to data.frame
```{r}
m = matrix(1:6,nrow=2,ncol=3)
class(m)
m
m = as.data.frame(m)
class(m)
m
```

## Code Chunk 9
## Accesing data from a data.frame
## This can be done using the same access operators for matrix objects [row,column]
## The 1st row
```{r}
players[1,]
```

## Code Chunk 10
## The 2nd column
```{r}
players[,2]
```

## Code Chunk 11
## The first 2 rows
```{r}
players[1:2,]
```

## Code Chunk 12
## The first 2 columns
```{r}
players[,1:2]
```


## Code Chunk 13
## Particular columns of the data.frame object can be accessed with the $ access operator followed by the column name
## The name column of the data.frame players
```{r}
players$name
```

## Code Chunk 14
## The second element of the name column
```{r}
players$name[2]
```

## Code Chunk 15
## Operations on data.frame
## Change the value 
```{r}
players$age+2   # add 2 to all the element of the age column
players$age[1] +3 # add 3 to the first element of the age column
players$age
```

## Code Chunk 16
## Add a new column with cbind()
```{r}
assists = c(9,8,3)
players = cbind(players,assists) # add one column with cbind()
players
```

## Code Chunk 17
## Add a new column with $
```{r}
players$goals = c(20,30,10)  # add one column with $
players
```

## Code Chunk 18
## Add new row with rbind()
```{r}
new_player = data.frame(name = "Suarez", age = 32, golden_ball= FALSE, goals = 40,assists=4) # add a new row to existing data.frame
rbind(players,new_player) 
players=rbind(players,new_player)
```


## Code Chunk 19
## Functions on data.frame
## mean(),max(),hist()...functions work on all numeric columns, since each column is a vector
```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
max(mtcars$carb)
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```


## Code Chunk 20
## summary() returns summary statistics of each column
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
summary(mtcars$mpg) # summary of a specific column
```



## Code Chunk 21 
## List
## A list is a generic vector containing any other objects.
## Use list() to construct
```{r}
my_list = list(players,c(1,2,3),matrix(1:6,2,3))
my_list
```

## Code Chunk 22
## List
## List: Reference & Sublist
## Use [[n]] to refer each slice of a list
```{r}
my_list[[1]] # returns the object of the 1st member of my_list 
class(my_list[[1]]) # it is a data.frame
summary(my_list[[1]])
```


## Code Chunk 23
## Use [n] to retrieve a sublist from a list
```{r}
my_list[1] # return a sublist 
class(my_list[1])  # it is a list
mean(my_list[1]) # my_list[1] is a list, mean() does not work on list
```


## Code Chunk 24
## use [n1:n2],[c()] to get a sublist of multiple members
```{r}
my_list[2:3]
my_list[c(1,3)]
```


## Code Chunk 25
## Class is really important in R
```{r}
my_list[[2]] # a vector
class(my_list[[2]]) # class is numeric
mean(my_list[[2]]) # mean() works on vector
my_list[2]  # a list 
class(my_list[2]) # class is list 
mean(my_list[2])  # mean() does not work on list
```


## Code Chunk 26
## Change a value of a member
```{r}
my_list[[3]]
my_list[[3]] = matrix(1:6,3,2)
my_list[[3]]
```


## Code Chunk 27
## Add new member to a list
```{r}
my_list[[4]] = runif(5)
my_list[[4]]
```


## Code Chunk 28
## Delete a member from a list
```{r}
my_list[[4]]= NULL
my_list[[4]] # the 4th element is already deleted
```


## Code Chunk 29
## Use length() to access the number of members in a list
```{r}
length(my_list)
```


## Code Chunk 30
## Factor 
## Why we use factors
## Demo:Factor 
## Create a character vector
```{r}
direction = c("North","West","North","East","South","West","North","South") #create a character vector
direction
class(direction)
```


## Code Chunk 31
## Use factor() to transform a vector to factor 
```{r}
factor_direction = factor(direction)  # create a factor of direction
factor_direction
class(factor_direction)
```


## Code Chunk 32
## Use levels() to access the unique value of a factor
```{r}
levels(factor_direction)
```

## Code Chunk 33
## Use table() to count the instances for each factor
```{r}
table(factor_direction)
```


## Code Chunk 34
## Create an ordered factor
```{r}
seasons = c("Spring","Fall","Summer","Spring","Fall","Winter","Winter")
factor_seasons = factor(seasons,levels=c("Spring","Summer","Fall","Winter"),ordered = TRUE)
factor_seasons[1] < factor_seasons[2] 
factor_seasons[2] < factor_seasons[3]
```

## Code Chunk 35
## Create a factor from continous value with cut()
## women is a built in data.frame of height&weight of women
```{r}
head(women)
```


## Code Chunk 36
## Let's look at the height of women
```{r}
women$height
```

## Code Chunk 37
## We want to create a factor corresponding to height, with three equally-spaced levels
```{r}
factor_height= cut(women$height,3)
table(factor_height)
```

## Code Chunk 38
## Use labels=argument in cut() to specify the levels of factors
```{r}
factor_height= cut(women$height,3,labels=c('Low','Medium','High'))
table(factor_height)
```
