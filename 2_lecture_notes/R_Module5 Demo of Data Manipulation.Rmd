## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Code Chunk 1
## R packages
## Install the packages
```{r,results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
mypackages = c("dplyr","lubridate","ggplot2")
install.packages(mypackages)
```


## Code Chunk 2
## Load the Packages into current session
```{r,results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```


## Code Chunk 3
## Data manipulation with dplyr
## Use the flights dataset
## This dataset contains all 336776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013
```{r}
flights = read.csv("/Users/hyeonwooyang/Desktop/Desktop/0_WUSTL/0_Business_Analytics/02_pre_coursework/01_Intro_to_R_Programming/Project/My_R_Project/data/nyc_flights.csv")
head(flights) # use head() to see the top rows of the data
```


## Code Chunk 4 
```{r}
dim(flights) # use dim() to see the dimensions of the data
```


## Code Chunk 5 
## Data Manipulation: Filter
## Filter rows with filter(data, requirement 1, requirement 2)
## Suppose you want to get all the flights departing at January 1st
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


## Code Chunk 6
## Difference between "==" & "="
## a==b returns a logical TRUE/FALSE of whether the value of a equals the value of b
## a = b assigns the value of b to a
```{r}
a = 3
b = 2
a == b # if a==b ?

a = b   # assign the value fo b to a
print(a)
print(b)
a == b   # if a == b ?

```


## Code Chunk 7
## Data Manipulation: Order
## Use arrange(data, attribute 1, attribute 2) to order data on some attributes
## Suppose you want to see flights ordered by the departure delay
## Order flights by ascending dep_delay
```{r}
arrange(flights,dep_delay)  # ascending order by default, see the result
flights = arrange(flights,dep_delay)  # overwrite flights with the ordered data.frame
```


## Code Chunk 8
## Order flights by descending dep_delay
```{r}
arrange(flights,desc(dep_delay))  #use desc() to specify decending order
```


## Code Chunk 9
## Data will first be ordered by attribute 1 then by attribute 2
## Order flights with multiple attributes: month/day/dep_delay
```{r}
arrange(flights,month,day,desc(dep_delay))  #ordering by multiple attributes
```


## Code Chunk 10
## Data Manipulation: Select
## Often you work with large datasets with many columns but only a few are actually of interest to you
## Use select(data, attribute 1,attribute 2) to get attributes of interest
```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day, carrier)
```


## Code Chunk 11
## Data Manipulation: Adding New column with existing columns
## Add new columns that are functions of existing columns with mutate(data, new attribute = f(existing attributes)) 
## Suppose you want to calculate the speed of each flights
```{r}
flights = mutate(flights, speed = distance/air_time*60, 
                total_delay = dep_delay + arr_delay) # mutate keeps the original columns 
flights$speed[1:10] # the first 10 rows of speed
flights$total_delay[1:10] # the first 10 rows of total delay
```


## Code Chunk 12
## Data Manipulation: Summarise
## Want to get some specific statistics of different attributes at the same time
## Use summarise(data,summarystat1 = FUN(attribute1), summarystat2 = FUN(attribute2))
## FUN: min(),max(),sum(),sd(),n(),n_distinct()
## n() count the number of an attribute
## n_distinct() count the number of unique values of an attribute
```{r}
summarise(flights,max(speed,na.rm=TRUE),
                  max(arr_delay,na.rm=TRUE),
                  max(distance,na.rm=TRUE),
                  min(distance,na.rm=TRUE),
                  n_distinct(dest))
```


## Code Chunk 13
## Suppose you want to know the maximum dep_delay and minimum dep_delay for all the flights in January
## use filter() to get all the flights of January
## use summarise() on the subset of data returned by filter
```{r}
x=filter(flights,month==1) # create a temporary data x
summarise(x,max(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE)
          ,min(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) # calculate the max and mean on the temporary data x
```

## Code Chunk 14
## With pipe operator
## Pipe operator %>% is used to chain code together
## Pass the return from filter() directly to summarise
## do not need to create temporary data x
```{r}
filter(flights,month==1) %>%
summarise(max(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE),
          min(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Quick Summary
## Syntax structure in dplyr
## The first argument is a data frame.
## The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame
## The return is a new data frame


## Data Analysis: Grouping and Aggregating
## We want to know the average departure delay for each origin and the total number of flights from the origin
## Group "flights" by attribute "origin" 
## Calculate average dep_delay for each group
## Count total number of flights for each group
## Create a new data.frame, each row stores the average dep_delay & total number of flights for each origin
## In dplyr
## group_by(attribute1,attribute2,...): splits the dataset to sub groups by attribute1,attribute2 ...
## aggregate functions: min(), max(), mean(), sum(), sd(), median(),n(),n_distinct()
## summarise() does aggregation on each group 
## group_by() & summarise() returns a new data.frame,each row is the aggregation stats of one group

## Code Chunk 15
## Data Analysis: Grouping and Aggregating
## Combination of group_by() & summarise()
## Use the pipe operator %>% 
```{r}
delay_origin_summary = flights %>% 
                        group_by(origin)  %>% 
                         summarise(
                         avg_delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm = TRUE), 
                         flights = n()
                        )
delay_origin_summary 
```

## Quick Summary: Grouping and Aggregating
## Always three parts in grouping analysis
## Attributes to group on: How to subset the dataset into pieces?
## Attributes to aggregate on: For each piece, what do I want to analyze?
## The method of aggregations: What kind of measure do I want, mean(), max(), etc



## Code Chunk 16
## Date Object Manipulation
## We will often deal with dates as business analysts
## Raw date data is mostly "character"
## We use "lubridate" package to clean the raw date data easily
```{r}
now = "2025-08-01 10:10:00"
class(now)
```


## Code Chunk 17
## Use ymd(),ymd_hms() to transform character to a date object,POSIXt in R
```{r}
now = ymd_hms(now)
class(now)
print(now)
```


## Code Chunk 18
## Date Object Manipulation
## Extract information from Date object
```{r}
year(now)
```


## Code Chunk 19
```{r}
weekdays(now)
```

## Code Chunk 20
## Get the weekdays from the time_hour column of flights
## Get total number of flights on different days
```{r}
flights$weekday=weekdays(ymd_hms(flights$time_hour))
table(flights$weekday) 
```


## Plot with ggplot
## Why ggplot?
## Flexible mapping data to visualization objects
## Construct a plot of multiple elements
## points
## line
## bar
## title
## Each element is a layer and could be added up like layers in Photoshop
## Grouping could be achieved by color

## Basic building blocks of ggplot
## Data
## Aesthetic mapping: x,y,color...
## Geometic Objects: points,lines,bars...



## Code Chunk 21  
## Plot with ggplot: Bar plot 
## Plot the count of flights for each carrier with
## data: flights
## x: carrier
## geom_bar()
  
```{r}
ggplot(flights) + geom_bar(aes(x = carrier)) 
# first parse the data flights to ggplot
# then tell geom_bar you want to group on carrier 
```


## Code Chunk 22
## You want to know the count of flights for each carrier on each origin
```{r}
ggplot(flights) + geom_bar(aes(x = carrier,fill=origin))  
# "x=carrier" tells ggplot to count the number of flights for each carrier
# "fill = origin" tells ggplot to fill the color by origin
```

## Code Chunk 23
## You want to add a titile to your plot
```{r}
ggplot(flights) + geom_bar(aes(x = carrier,fill=origin)) + labs(title ="Flights by Carriers & Airport in New York City")
# use labs() to change lables to your plot, like x,y,title...
```



## Code Chunk 24
## Plot with ggplot: Scatter plot 
## Plot the relationship between distance & air_time with geom_point()
## data:flights
## x: distance
## y: air_time
## plot type: point
```{r}
ggplot(flights) + geom_point(aes(x=distance,y=air_time))
```
