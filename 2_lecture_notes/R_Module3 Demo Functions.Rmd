## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Code Chunk 1
## Function: Basic
## Call a function by passing values to arguments
## Suppose you want to generate the following sequence:  1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0
## Without function, you could do the following

```{r}
t = c(1.0,1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0)
t
```


## Code Chunk 2
## With seq() function, you only specifiy the input argument from=1,to=2,by=0.1
```{r}
t = seq(from = 1, to = 2, by = 0.1) 
t
```

## Code Chunk 3
## The following calls are equivalent
```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 2, by = 0.1)
seq(1,2,0.1)
seq(by = 0.1,from = 1, to = 2)
```


## Code Chunk 4
## Default argument values in functions
## rnorm(): random normal generators 
## n: number of observations, no default, user must specify a value
## mean: default $0$
## sd: default $1$
```{r}
# help(rnorm)
rnorm() # call rnorm() without specifying the length n
e = rnorm(n=1000) # 1000 observations from Standard normal N(0,1) 
mean(e) # check the mean
sd(e)   # check the standard deviation
hist(e) # use hist() to plot the distribution
```

## Code Chunk 5
## Example: use rnorm() to generate nornal distribution with specific mean/sd

```{r}
e1 = rnorm(n=1000, mean = 3, sd = 5) # 1000 values from N(3,5) 
mean(e1)
sd(e1)
hist(e1) 
```

## Code Chunk 6
## User-Defined Function
```{r}
MyPowerFunction = function(arg1,arg2){
		return(arg1^arg2)
} ##Defined MyPowerFunction
MyPowerFunction ## What is inside the function?
MyPowerFunction(2,3) ## 2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8
```
